# Housing-prediction
we will import the required libraries. Next, we will load the housing data from the scikit-learn library and understand it. 
The prices of the house indicated by the variable MEDV is our target variable and the remaining are the feature variables based on which we will predict the value of a house.

CONTENT:
Data: contains the information for various houses
target: prices of the house
feature_names: names of the features
DESCR: describes the dataset

DATA PROCESSING:
After loading the data, itâ€™s a good practice to see if there are any missing values in the data. We count the number of missing values for each feature.

EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS:
Exploratory Data Analysis is a very important step before training the model. 
In this section, we will use some visualizations to understand the relationship of the target variable with other features.

OBSERVATIONS:
The prices increase as the value of RM increases linearly,,The prices tend to decrease with an increase in LSTAT.
